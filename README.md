# Xebia Internship Projects 🚀

This repository contains a collection of machine learning and data science projects developed during my internship at **Xebia**. Each folder includes a complete end-to-end pipeline: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a `Streamlit`-based interactive web application for deployment.
